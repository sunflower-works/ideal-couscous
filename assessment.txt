import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class EncoderDecoder(nn.Module):
    """Neural network for end-to-end watermarking"""

    def __init__(self, payload_size=64, image_size=128):
        super().__init__()

        # Encoder network
        self.encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(3 + 1, 64, 3, padding=1),  # +1 for message channel
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(64, 64, 3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(64, 3, 3, padding=1)
        )

        # Decoder network
        self.decoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Conv2d(3, 64, 3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(64, 64, 3, padding=1),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Conv2d(64, payload_size, 3, padding=1),

            nn.Flatten(),
            nn.Sigmoid()
        )

    def forward(self, image, message):
        # Repeat message to match image spatial dimensions
        message = message.view(-1, 1, 1, 1).repeat(1, 1, image.size(2), image.size(3))

        # Concatenate image and message
        combined = torch.cat([image, message], dim=1)

        # Encode watermarked image

        shift_x, shift_y = torch.randint(-5, 6, (2,))
        shifted = torch.roll(image, shifts=(shift_x, shift_y), dims=(2, 3))

        # Combine attacks
        attacked = image + jpeg_noise + gaussian_noise
        attacked = 0.7 * attacked + 0.3 * shifted

        return torch.clamp(attacked, 0, 1)

# Training procedure
def train_watermarking_model():
    model = EncoderDecoder()
    adversary = AdversarialNoise()
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

    # Loss functions

## 🔥 Cutting-Edge Techniques in Steganographic Watermarking

### 1. **Deep Learning-Based Hybrid Approaches**
The integration of deep learning with traditional steganographic methods represents the current forefront of research. The most advanced approaches combine **Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)** with **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to create robust solutions that maintain both data integrity and security. These hybrid architectures leverage the strengths of both spatial and transform domains, overcoming limitations of individual techniques .

Recent implementations achieve remarkable performance metrics, with:
- **Mean Square Error (MSE) of 93.30%**
- **Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 58.27%**
- **Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of 94.20%**

These systems use GANs to generate synthetic cover images and learn optimal embedding positions and strengths, making the steganography less detectable while maintaining visual quality .

### 2. **Reversible Steganography with Attention Mechanisms**
Advanced reversible image steganography networks like **RISRANet** utilize residual structures and mixed attention mechanisms to achieve high fidelity in both stego images and recovered secret images. These systems employ:

- **Invertible Neural Networks (INN)** as the overall framework
- **Channel shuffle operations** to promote information interaction between different features
- **Dilated convolution** to design multi-scale convolution attention modules
- **Structural similarity metrics** in loss functions to improve recovery accuracy

This approach allows for secure hiding and **lossless extraction** of secret images, outperforming comparative algorithms across multiple evaluation metrics .

### 3. **Transformer-Based Normalizing Flow Models**
The integration of transformer architectures with normalizing flow models represents another cutting-edge approach. The **Robust Message Steganography (RMSteg)** framework hides messages via QR codes in host images using normalizing flow-based models, creating stego images with imperceptible changes that can survive printing and photographing .

This approach is particularly significant as it:
- Leverages the tokenized representation of images natural suitability for steganography
- Maintains decoding accuracy despite various real-world image distortions
- Represents the first integration of transformer advantages into normalizing flow for steganography

### 4. **Squeeze-and-Excitation with Inception Architectures**
For big data security applications, particularly in sensitive fields like telemedicine, advanced frameworks combine **Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks**, **Inception modules**, and **residual connections**. These systems are specifically designed for deployment on edge devices like the **NVIDIA Jetson TX2**, enabling real-time, low-power operation suitable for healthcare applications .

Performance achievements include:
- **PSNR values of 39.02 and 38.75**
- **SSIM values of 0.9757**
- Minimal visual distortion while maintaining diagnostic integrity

### 5. **Multimodal and Linguistic Domain Steganography**
The most revolutionary approaches move **beyond spatial and temporal domains** entirely. These methods use a chain of multimodal AI to deconstruct audiovisual content into cover text, embed messages within the linguistic domain, and then reconstruct synchronized audiovisual content from the stego text .

This paradigm shift offers unprecedented robustness against manipulations like:
- Face-swapping
- Voice-cloning
- Audiovisual resampling
- Other deepfake techniques

The message encoding biases word sampling processes in language generation models, while decoding analyzes probability distributions of word choices, making the approach inherently resistant to audiovisual manipulations .

### 6. **Wavelet-Based Deep Learning Fusion**
Building upon DeepWaveletFusion, advanced approaches like **DeepWaveletFusionToo** integrate convolutional neural networks with the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to enhance both embedding and recovery performance. These lightweight architectures use custom DWT image datasets and mean squared error loss functions to reduce model complexity and computational costs while maintaining competitive recovery accuracy .

### 7. **Generative Audio Steganography**
For audio applications, frameworks like **BirdsSong** represent the cutting edge by combining style vectors from reference audio datasets with content vectors derived from secret messages. This approach:
- Generates coverless stego audio with diverse styles
- Resists traditional steganalysis techniques
- Maintains high audio quality and stylistic consistency
- Enables near-lossless recovery of secret messages

Recent analysis identifies four notable stegomalware examples in 2025:
1. **W3CryptoLocker** - Ransomware delivered via SmokeLoader hiding payload in Base64-encoded images
2. **Sosano backdoor** - Uses polyglot files to obfuscate its infection chain
3. **XWorm and Remcos/AsyncRAT** - Leverage steganography for keylogging, data theft, and remote control

## 🔮 Future Directions and Challenges

The future of steganographic watermarking will likely focus on:
