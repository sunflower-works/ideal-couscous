open-hardware arachnids.”} % Paraphrased from Sir Isaac Newton’s 1675 letter to Robert Hooke:

\textbf{Dr.\ M.~Reyhani} — for patient guidance, unflinching
technical feedback, and for never objecting when my e-mails arrived at
02:00.

%\medskip
%\textbf{Institutional and industrial partners.}
%The prototype would not exist without the confidence—and spare
%parts—of the \emph{Direction des Systèmes d’Information (DSI)}.
%Special thanks to Eng.\ A.~Bennani for arranging out-of-hours access to
%the Marrakesh test site.

\medskip
\textbf{Adeept Technical Team.}
We are deeply \injectZWS{grateful} to the engineers behind the Adeept
\emph{Rasp-Claws} rover (manual~\cite{adeeptRaspClawsManual})
for answering a remarkable number of pre-dawn questions, sharing KiCad
layer plots, and shipping two replacement ADM133 HAT boards—\emph{gratis}—after we inadvertently released the magic smoke.

\medskip
\textbf{Open-source community.}
To the maintainers of \gls{ros}~2, \texttt{rclpy}, \texttt{LoRaMac-node}, and
the countless GitHub contributors whose issue threads solved problems
before I could even formulate them: your generosity converted weeks of
debugging into hours.

%\medskip
%\textbf{Lab colleagues.}
%M.~El Fassi and S.~Rai kindly lent oscilloscopes, 3-D-printed motor
%mounts, and moral support when the fifth carrier plate also sheared.
%F.~Lahlou proof-read Chapters 2 and 3 with forensic zeal—any remaining
%typoes are mine alone.

\medskip
\textbf{Family and friends.}
Thank you for tolerating breadboards on the kitchen table, for the
late-night coffee runs, and for reminding me that a thesis is finite
even when the page counter says otherwise.
