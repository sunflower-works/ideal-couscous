% Appendix: Reproducibility / Full Bill of Materials
\chapter{Full Bill of Materials and Reproducibility Notes}\label{ch:repro_bom}

This appendix provides the exhaustive Bill of Materials (BOM) for the
prototype platform.
The main text presents only a concise summary
(Table~\ref{tab:raspclaws-spec}) to reduce cognitive load; here every
considered line item is retained (accepted, rejected, or pending) for
audit and replication.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Column “Final” marks whether the part is present in the fabricated build (\BOMYes) or a discarded / deferred alternative (\BOMNo).
  \item Unit prices are indicative and may drift; regenerate prior to procurement with: \texttt{make bom}.
  \item Formatting quirks (e.g., power ranges, scanning angles) are normalised automatically by \texttt{scripts/generate_bom\_tables.py}.
  \item The authoritative editable source lives in the CSV: \texttt{toolset/csv(BOM).csv}.
\end{itemize}
